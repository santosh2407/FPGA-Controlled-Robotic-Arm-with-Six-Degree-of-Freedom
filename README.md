# FPGA-Controlled-Robotic-Arm-with-Six-Degree-of-Freedom
- In this project, I have designed a robotic arm with six degree of freedom and it can be controlled through an FPGA. However, this approach of using FPGA to controll the robotic arm is a bit expensive but it will give accurate results as compared to the approach which deals with the controlling the robotic arm with the Microcontroller. 
- Custom ASIC package offers relatively high speed but the major drawback of this process is that is it very expensive. So, a middle path is FPGA to implement the robotic arm.
